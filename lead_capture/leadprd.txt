4. System Architecture & Data Pipeline
4.1 Lead Form Flow (Customer-Facing)

💡 Intelligent Intake System (Minimal Questions, AI-Enhanced)

    User lands on referral link (pre-fills referring agent).
    Asks for basic info:
        Auto: ZIP Code + License Plate (or VIN)
        Home: Address
        Business: Business Name / EIN
    Prefill Data from APIs
        VIN Lookup → Make, Model, Year
        Property Data → Square Footage, Flood Risk
        Google My Business API → Business Info
    Show Personalized Quotes
        Sorted by price & coverage options.
    Customer chooses next step:
    ✅ Talk to an agent (Now or Later)

    ✅ Proceed to insurer’s website

4.2 Data Pipeline

    User enters basic details → Prefill APIs fetch additional data.
